# BookBuilder
An automatic practical Chess opening repertoire builder.


If you want to understand why this exists, how it works, or get example repertoires, check here:

## GUI Update
The awesome @drauf has built an interface. It should be much more self explanatory now!

## ChessBook Update
I'm no longer actively udpating BookBuilder, but the good people at https://chessbook.com/ have implemented many of the principles in a much more user friendly way. If you're interested in building your own repertoire I would start there. I'm not affiliated in any way.
